# Preprocessing scripts

## Adrian's scripts:
- data_per_rat.m
- percentages_per_type.m : Loads GC filtered waveforms and computes the amount of events, to estimate a proportion of occurrence per event type. 
-  compute_features_pca_filtered_events.m: Uses PCA-filtered traces to then compute its features.
